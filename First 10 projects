print(color)
print(animal)
Output:
Blue
Lion

Project 3:  Gross Pay
Gross Pay Project
Instruction
Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour to compute gross pay. You need to take into account that the result has exactly two digits after the decimal place.
Input
Enter Hours: 35
Enter Rate: 2.75
Output
Pay: 96.25

Code:
hour = input("Enter Hours: ")
rate = input("Enter Rate: ")
hour = float(hour)
rate = float(rate)
pay = round(hour*rate,2)
print(f"Pay: {pay}")

Output:
Pay: 96.25

Project 4:
Celsius to Fahrenheit Project
Instruction
Write a program which prompts the user for a Celsius temperature, convert the temperature to Fahrenheit, and print out the converted temperature. Formula : (°C × 9/5) + 32 = °F
Input
Enter Temperature in Celsius: 10
Output
10 Celsius = 50 Fahrenheit

Code:
celcsius = input("Enter Temperature in Celsius:")
fahrenheit = (int(celcsius) * 9/5) + 32
print(f"{celcsius} Celsius = {fahrenheit} Fahrenheit")

Output:
Enter Temperature in Celsius: 10
Output
10 Celsius = 50 Fahrenheit

Project 5:
Trip Cost Calculator Project:
Instruction
Write a program which calculates trip cost for a user.

Create a greeting for your program.
Ask the user for number of days.
Ask the user for hotel price.
Ask the user for flight price.
Ask the user for rental car price.
Ask for other expenses.
Combine all expenses together and print with 2 digits after decimal places.
Input
Welcome to the Trip Cost Calculator!
How many days will you stay? 3
How much does hotel cost per night? $30
How much does flight cost? $50
If you need rental car please enter the price otherwise enter zero. $10
Enter other possible expenses $0
Output
Total Cost: $170.0

Code:
print("Welcome to the Trip Cost Calculator!")
number_days = int(input("How many days will you stay? "))
hotel_price = float(input("How much does hotel cost per night? $"))
flight_cost = float(input("How much does flight cost? $"))
car_rent = float(input("If you need rental car please enter the price otherwise enter zero. $"))
other_expenses = float(input("Enter other possible expenses $"))
total_cost = number_days * hotel_price + flight_cost + car_rent * number_days + other_expenses
print(f"Total Cost: ${total_cost}")

Output:
Total Cost: $170.0


Project 6:
Gross Pay with Ovetime
Instruction
Rewrite the Gross Pay Project (Project 3) program to give the employee 1.5 times the hourly rate for hours worked above 40 hours. Here again the program prompts the user for hours and rate per hour to compute gross pay. You need to take into account that the result has exactly two digits after the decimal place.

Hint: overtime = hour - 40

Input
Enter Hours: 45
Enter Rate: 5
Output
Pay: 237.5

Code:
hour = input("Enter Hours: ")
rate = input("Enter Rate: ")
hour = float(hour)
rate = float(rate)

if hour < 40:
    pay = round(hour*rate,2)
else:
    overtime = hour - 40;
    pay = (rate * 40.0) + (1.5 * rate * overtime)

print(f"Pay: {pay}")

Output:Pay: 237.5

Project 7:
Project 7 - Leap Year
Instructions
Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February.

Three criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:

This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.

The year must be evenly divisible by 4; If the year can also be evenly divided by 100, it is not a leap year; **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400

e.g. The year 2000:

2000 ÷ 4 = 500 (Leap)

2000 ÷ 100 = 20 (Not Leap)

2000 ÷ 400 = 5 (Leap!)

So the year 2000 is a leap year.

Example Input
2400
Example Output
Leap year.
Code:
year = int(input("Enter year: "))
if year % 4 == 0:
  if year % 100 == 0:
    if year % 400 == 0:
      print("Leap year.")
    else:
      print("Not leap year.")
  else:
    print("Leap year.")
else:
  print("Not leap year.")
  
Project 7:
Project 8 - Love Calculator
Instructions
Write a program to test the compatibility between two people.

Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 85, the message should be:

"Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."

For Love Scores between 40 and 70, the message should be:

"Your score is **y**, you are alright together."

Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:

"Your score is **z**."

Example

name1 = "David"

name2 = "Jennifer"

T occurs 0 times

R occurs 1 time

U occurs 0 times

E occurs 2 times

Total = 3

L occurs 0 time

O occurs 0 times

V occurs 1 times

E occurs 2 times

Total = 3

Love Score = 33

Print: "Your score is 33."

Example Input 1
name1 = "David"
name2 = "Jennifer"
Example Output 1
Your score is 33.
Hint
The lower() function changes all the letters in a string to lower case.

The count() function will give you the number of times a letter occurs in a string.
Code:
print("Welcome to Love Calculator!")
name1 = input("Enter your name: ")
name2 = input("Enter your lover name: ")

combined_name = name1 + name2

lower_cased_name = combined_name.lower()

t = lower_cased_name.count("t")
r = lower_cased_name.count("r")
u = lower_cased_name.count("u")
e = lower_cased_name.count("e")

true = t + r + u + e

l = lower_cased_name.count("l")
o = lower_cased_name.count("o")
v = lower_cased_name.count("v")
e = lower_cased_name.count("e")

love = l + o + v + e

love_score = int(str(true) + str(love))
print(love_score)

if love_score < 10 or love_score > 85:
    print(f"Your score is {love_score}, you go together like coke and mentos")
elif love_score >= 40 and love_score <= 70:
    print(f"Your score is {love_score}, you alright go together")
else:
    print(f"Your score is {love_score}")
